# Background

- Diffusion MRI measures tissue properties of white matter, which contains long-range connections between different brain regions.
- Raw diffusion data can be engineered into different "feature sets" for use in predictive models. 
- Comparison of a variety of feature sets and models for both accuracy of predicutions and variance/bias of beta coefficients can help determine which models are more optimal for different feature sets.
  
# Methods

- We used diffusion data from 1041 participants from the Human Connectome Project, processed into "tract profiles" using pyAFQ (cite) and "local connectome" features using DSI-Studio (cite).
- LASSO models were run on both tract profiles and local connectome to predict a variety of cognitive outcomes.
- Sparse Group LASSO (SGL) models were run on only tract profiles, to take advantage of the inherent grouping of the data.
- Models were implemented in `R` and trained using nested cross-validation and boostrap resampling. 

- Explanation of/diagram of SGL here.

# Results

- There were no significant differences in the accuracy of models using tract profiles and local connectomes as their input features (Figure 1.)
- There were significant differences in the variability of model weights for LASSO and SGL models.
