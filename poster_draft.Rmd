# Background

- Diffusion MRI (dMRI) measures tissue properties of white matter, which contains long-range connections between different brain regions.
- Brain-behavior models can be used link neuroimaging features and phenotypes.
- dMRI can be processed into model input features in several ways. 
- There are a multitude of different regularization methods for predictive models. 

**Question:** How do sets of features derived from different dMRI processing methods compare in model accuracy and variability? 


# Methods

- Diffusion MRI from 1041 Human Connectome Project participants.
- Processed into "tract profiles" (2400 features) using pyAFQ and "local connectome fingerprint" (100,000) using DSI-Studio (cite).
- LASSO regularizated models fit to tract profiles and local connectomes seperately. 
- Sparse Group LASSO (SGL) models fit to tract profiles, grouped by tract.
- Prediction targets were various cognitive phenotypes. 
- Models implemented in `R` and trained using nested cross-validation and boostrap resampling.
- Placeholder for more details?

# Conclusions 
- Tractometry contains equivalent predictive information as compared to local connectome, with much fewer features.
- Utilizing a variety of regularization methods and feature engineering can maximize interpretability of models.
- this is more conclusions
- testing page limits
- This will be replaced with an insightful comment about the results
- Lots of space for conclusions
- Placeholder
- I just want the results to wrap to the other side

# Results


![Caption for the picture.](../hcp-tractometry/Figures/lc_vs_tract-lasso-sgl.png){#id .class width=100% height=100%}
**Model accuracies for behavioral phenotypes.** All models, regardless of regularization method or feature set performed statistically equivalently. 


![Caption for the picture.](fig7.JPEG){#id .class width=100% height=100%}
**"Age" prediction model weights across tracts for SGL and LASSO.** Solid lines show the mean model weight across bootstraps for every tract, across every node, and the shaded areas show the 95\% confidence intervals of the model weights. Note the reduced y-axis range for SGL.
