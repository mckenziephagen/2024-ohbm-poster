# Background

- Diffusion MRI (dMRI) measures tissue properties of white matter, which contains long-range connections between different brain regions.
- Brain-behavior models can be used link neuroimaging features and phenotypes. 

**Question:** How do sets of features derived from different dMRI processing methods compare in model accuracy and variability? 


# Methods

- Diffusion MRI from 1041 Human Connectome Project participants
- Processed into "tract profiles" using pyAFQ (cite) and "local connectome" features using DSI-Studio (cite).
- LASSO models were run on both tract profiles and local connectome. 
- Sparse Group LASSO (SGL) models  run on only tract profiles.
- Prediction targets were various cognitive phenotypes. 
- Models implemented using `R` and trained using nested cross-validation and boostrap resampling.

# Conclusions (rough wording)
- The selection of model and feature set might not be influential on the accuracy, but may result in less variable, more interpretable models.
- Tract profiles and local connectome have similar accuracies, but the grouping of tract profiles combined with SGL is good*
- Splitting families across the train/test splits is bad practice, but didn't have a large effect on the outcome.
