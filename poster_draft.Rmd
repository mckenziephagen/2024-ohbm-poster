# Background

- Diffusion MRI measures tissue properties of white matter, which contains long-range connections between different brain regions.
- Raw diffusion data can be engineered into different "feature sets" for use in predictive models. 
- Comparison of a variety of feature sets and models for both accuracy of predicutions and variance/bias of beta coefficients can help determine which models are more optimal for different feature sets.
  
# Methods

- We used diffusion data from 1041 participants from the Human Connectome Project, processed into "tract profiles" using pyAFQ (cite) and "local connectome" features using DSI-Studio (cite).
- LASSO models were run on both tract profiles and local connectome to predict a variety of cognitive outcomes.
- Sparse Group LASSO (SGL) models were run on only tract profiles, to take advantage of the inherent tract groupings.
- Models were implemented in `R` and trained using nested cross-validation and boostrap resampling (link to code). 

- Explanation of/diagram of SGL here.

# Conclusions (rough wording)
- The selection of model and feature set might not be influential on the accuracy, but may result in less variable, more interpretable models.
- Tract profiles and local connectome have similar accuracies, but the grouping of tract profiles combined with SGL is good*
- Splitting families across the train/test splits is bad practice, but didn't have a large effect on the outcome. 
  


# Additional Results
- The inclusion of bootstrapping in our analytic pipeline appeared to decrease the accuracy of the models.** maybe
- Avoiding leakage by not spltting realted subjects across the train/test splits did not have a significant effect.
